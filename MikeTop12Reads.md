So folks know that I like to read a little every day to grow professionally and keep my ax sharp.  Here are my current top twelve books I’ve read that have influenced my perspective and thinking around a number of topics.  The topics covered everything from being highly technical to the best approaches for leadership and technology organizational design.  One pattern for success that I’ve seen played out several times in my career and others have said the same is read what other great minds have figured out and then do what they say.  It is often in the application of their guidance and principles that most of the challenge lies but never the less there is great wisdom in these books that can make our organization and you wildly successful.



David Marquet - Motivating technology organizations is fundamentally different than most other types of industries and organizations.  Almost all industrial age management practices are at best ineffective or at worst detrimental to maximing the capabilities of technology organizations.  David’s research is fundamental to understanding the differences and the leading science behind this.

Leadership is Language - Covers the science, difference between different types of work, how applying the wrong approaches can lead to disaster, and new techniques to work with knowledge workers.

Mark Horstman - Few authors are as prescriptive and evidenced-based in management practices as Mark.  He provides a lot of great insights into do’s and don’ts for managers as well as tons of free podcasts on a whole litany of subjects are career growth, management, relationship dynamics, organizational politics, etc.

The Effective Hiring Manager - Best practices around how to hire great talent as well as common mistakes to avoid.

The Effective Manager - Best practices around managing a direct as well as very solid and prescriptive approach to one on ones, providing feedback, etc.

Jonathan Smart - Lays the foundations for how to transform and get results in technology organizations.  He does an excellent job explaining why and how many transformations fail and what leaders can do to ensure they are focused on the right outcomes and problems that need to be solved.

Sooner, Safer, Happier - Antipatterns and patterns for business agility

Matthew Skelton - Team design and organizational structure is often a frequent debate in technology organizations.  Matt provides a lot of guidance and terminology to help align teams and organizations for success

Team Topologies - Explores different types of team designs, best practices, implications of Conway’s Law, and different things to consider as well as patterns to follow when organizing teams.

Charles Araujo - Former Cigna leader who has moved on and provided a vision for where the digital age is taking us as technology organizations.

The Quantum Age of IT - Does an excellent job of walking through the history of our industry, the market and technology forces driving change today, and how it all will converge and drive organizations into the digital age.

Nicole Forsgren, PhD - Nicole’s work turned a lot of the subjective advise given for years into concrete science.  This has lead to an explosion in research and study which have confirmed what many suspected for years and now fully embrace with the digital age.  Organizational success can be statistically predicted based on the technical execution of teams and the supporting organizational management practices and culture that support it.

Accelerate - Covers many technical, management, and cultural practices that based on extensive industry research have been proven to lead to organizational success (market share, profit, efficiency).  Summarizes this by distilling it down to 24 key capabilities to drive organizational improvement.

Jocko Willink - Tons of great insights into how to get results by taking ownership of the problem / mission.  Coming from the navy seals provides Jocko with a lot of really cool stories to tell and great examples of how great leaders and teams operate.

Extreme Ownership - Great read with a lot of really cool Navy Seal stories to help connect the principles with real life examples.

Dale Carnegie - Best advice for how to win others to your side.  Technology organizations require winning not from role authority but by selling and winning others to your perspective.  Dale Carnegie’s advice is timeless and can be applied to almost any situation.

How to Win Friends and Influence People - Great techniques to as the title says, win friends and influence people.

Robert Martin - Most of my thinking around how teams should operate / deliver is based on his writtings and philosophy.  The approaches he exposes are some of the simplest and yet hardest for teams and especially engineers to master.  Master them and you will actually see a difference.  Don’t and you will do the same thing you have always done just with new fancy agile names.

Clean Agile - Best picture of what agile is supposed to look like vs. what we always see

Agile Principles Patterns & Practices in C# - Great prescriptive guidance for engineers to apply to how they write code and work.  Agile fundamentally changes how engineers right code yet 99% of engineers still write code like we did in the 1980’s.

Martin Kleppmann - Many engineers go their entire careers without fully understanding the mathematical principles and forces behind data and thus make bad assumptions or poor choices for their solutions.  Any time you store data, regardless of whether it is in a file, the newest most advanced cloud NoSQL technology, or written on a post-it note: your solution is now governed by mathematical principles and physics that will limit your ability to scale.  His work and vision for future data technologies provide the tools engineers need to make the right choices for data storage without being distracted by the hype of a multi-billion dollar industry looking to sell their wares.

Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Starts with the simplest of problems and builds incrementally chapter by chapter to help the reader understand the physics, mathematical theorems, and forces at play that govern data management systems.  Finally, he ends with the future for scaling data systems as the demands placed on data management systems will only increase with time.

From "Inspired" by Marty Cagan

**Measure Product Progress**

*I have long been a strong advocate of using data to drive product teams.  Rather than provide the team an old-style roadmap listing someone’s best guess of what features may or may not work, I strongly prefer to provide the product team with a set of business objectives-with measurable goals-and then the team makes the calls as to what are the best ways to achieve those goals.  It’s part of the larger trend in product to focus on outcome and not output.*

IMO, depends what is meant by "feature branch" but in general I agree with you. The literature out there has varying definitions and differ on context. The fundamental is only one long lived branch and all other branches are short lived. Preference for the ever shrinking lifespans for short lived branches. If we say we discourage feature branches that last several weeks in favor of short lived story branches that last a few days...that is an improvement.

If we say we discourage story branches that last several days in favor of short lived task branches that last a few hours...that is an improvement.


TBD consistenty shows up in research as a key accelerator for teams.  The underlying forces at play that drive these results are:
1) Limits WIP
2) Drives increasing deployment frequency
3) Shortens feedback loops through accelerated CI/CD

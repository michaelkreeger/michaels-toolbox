It is critical when communicating priorities to teams to always do so in terms of a prioritized list (i.e. backlog).  Words such as "ASAP", "Must Have", "Critical" are not effective communcation with a dev team.  You may inadvertently confuse them on what item they should be working on now or next and may induce unneeded pressure which will only stress them out and slow down the team.  I understand there is pressure in the role of PO, it is a role intentionally designed with pressure in mind, but if we allow that pressure to infect our teams we will slow them down, not spur them on to some new level of performance.

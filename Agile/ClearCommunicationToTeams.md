I’ve been seeing a pattern across teams during team ceremonies as of late so wanted to share some observations and thoughts with everyone. 

It is critical when communicating priorities to dev teams to do so in terms of a prioritized list (i.e. backlog). An example would be “this #7 in our backlog”. Words such as "ASAP", "Must Have", "Critical" are not effective communication to a dev team and don’t convey to the team where the PO is steering the ship. It also doesn’t invite the important discussions around impact, value, and opportunities to adjust other items in the prioritized list. Using these ineffective words may inadvertently confuse the dev team on what item they should be working on now, next, and may also induce unhelpful stress which will only slow down delivery further. I understand completely that these are words which are comfortable for leadership, customers, or those not as familiar with product delivery but it is our job to filter and process that information and translate into something actionable and clear…a prioritized backlog. 

POs: Please try communicating to the team without using these words. 
Dev Teams: Hold your PO accountable for always providing you a prioritized backlog and communicating clearly in those teams. 
Scrum Masters: Coach, raise a yellow flag during meetings, call a timeout, etc. Don’t let this go on.

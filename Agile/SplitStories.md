This is a good video for PO's.  Mike Cohn is considered the industry leader in user story guidance.  The only thing I differ in guidance from Mike Cohn on is his guidance around spikes as I see them abused more than helpful and if used to simply carve out work the team will already do they can quickly become an anti-pattern as we expect learning to happen with everything we do.

Good article from Ron Jefferies (1 of 3 founders of XP): https://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/jatsustainablepace/
CNBC article which looks more at the overall economy: https://www.cnbc.com/2015/01/26/working-more-than-50-hours-makes-you-less-productive.html
- explains the drop off a cliff after 50 hours per week
- says shorts bursts of overtime are okay and might be helpful

Short team impacts to overtime
- We need teams to work smarter, not harder.  More opportunity to save time by improved designs, eliminating less valuable features, creative thinking
- Teams inevitablly sacrifice quality to get out of overtime mode.  This is ironically is the same thing that slows them down...lack of quality.
- Research is clear that pressure / stress dramatically impaires the ability to do knowledge work.
- Studies even of non-knowledge workers suggest that anything over 50 hours a week is almost pointless.

Long term
- Data / Metrics
  - Almost all data and metrics are predicated on sustainable pace with unbiased actors.  Overtime breaks both assumptions.
- Turnover of top talent
  - Burnout
  - Competitive job market
- Innovation
  - Teams don't innovate when in red mode
- Death spiral
  - Quality and productivity suffer which lead to slower delivery which pushes the organization to ask for overtime and thus the spiral ensues

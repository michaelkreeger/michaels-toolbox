What is DORA?
The DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team is a research program that was acquired by Google in 2018. Their goal is to understand the practices, processes, and capabilities that enable teams to achieve high performance in software and value delivery. From 2014 until 2019, the group published their best known studies, a series of annual reports to benchmark DevOps practices, answer questions common to many DevOps teams, and ultimately provide guidance for how DevOps teams can continuously improve their processes and capabilities.
In their 2018 book, Accelerate, the DORA team identified a set of metrics which they claim indicates software teams' performance as it pertains to software development and delivery capabilities. Change Lead Time, Deployment Frequency, Mean Time to Resolution, and Change Failure Rate. These metrics have come to be known as DORA metrics.

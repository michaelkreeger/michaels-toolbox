Why TDD:
1. Dramatically reduce defects / bugs
2. Improved predictability of team
3. You only code what's needed
4. More modular design (adhearance to SOLID)
5. Easier to maintain, refactor, etc.
6. Tests serve as code documentation
7. Less debugging
8. Faster feedback to developer
9. Overall, long term reduces time (reduces bug diagnosis at later stages in development, reduces production defects, etc.)


The Practice:
1. Whole team writes acceptance tests, unhappy path tests, edge test cases, etc.
2. Developers write code using TDD practices.
3. Working software is measured by automated tests that ensure working software.

Agile Context:
TDD was considered critical to agile software development at its inception (XP).
- XP calls it out directly
- Jeff Sutherland specifically mentions the importance of XP disciplines incorporation with Scrum
- Kent Beck - "I’m Not a Great Programmer, I’m Just a Good Programmer With Great Habits."

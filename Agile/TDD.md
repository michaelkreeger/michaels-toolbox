1. Whole team writes acceptance tests, unhappy path tests, edge test cases, etc.
2. Developers write code using TDD practices.
3. Working software is measured by automated tests that ensure working software.


TDD was considered critical to agile software development at its inception (XP).
Benifits:
1. You only code what's needed
2. More modular design (adhearance to SOLID)
3. Easier to maintain, refactor, etc.
4. Tests serve as code documentation
5. Less debugging
6. Faster feedback / iterations

I just finished the video.  I think Allen has a few good points.  I also think he misses the team benefits / disciplines that come with story points.  The velocity and estimation is a by product of the story point estimation.  The main intent is to help the team break down work and ensure alignment with the developers.  Blind voting often exposes team members who were not engaged in conversation or had different ideas about how / what work would be performed.  Additionally, as the team sees their velocity they begin to re-calibrate their appetite for accepting work for the next sprint.  A team that sees their velocity from past sprints at 18, 25, 20, etc. should think twice before pulling in a 35 points to a sprint....maybe they still do take all that work in but the team should reflect on their data to recalibrate their own perspectives and refine their own self awareness.  The other thing I would say is that story pointing when done correctly doesn't really take any time.  Story pointing should periodically punctuate a backlog refinement session to help align the team and capture data points that the team and specifically the PO can use to recalibrate direction / strategy.  A story might be considered valuable but if sized too high the team/PO may quickly kill it and move to the next avoiding needless churn.  All good food for thought....thanks for sharing.

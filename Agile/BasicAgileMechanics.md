Mechanics
-	Sprint Planning
o	The PO presents the items in priority order that he/she desires the team to achieve this sprint.
o	The capacity of the team and number of items presented should be measured.  This is based on story points, past team velocity, feedback from the team, and normal adjustments made for things like vacations, holidays, etc.
o	The engineers through fist-of-five blind voting express their level of confidence for completing all the items for the sprint.
o	If the engineers express a low confidence then the PO pulls items from the sprint until the engineers are confident.
o	Sprint planning is complete once the team is confident they will achieve all the stories for the sprint.  This is the team “commitment”.
-	Changes to a Running Sprint
o	If during the middle of a sprint the PO wishes to change things the team is doing (i.e. add something new into the sprint)
	The team commitment is voided
	The PO makes whatever priority adjustments he/she desires
	The team re-votes on their confidence to be successful this sprint
	If the team expresses they can’t be successful then the PO pulls items from the sprint.

Principle: The work committed to as part of sprint planning should be what the team feels confident they can complete.
The team is always free to pull in additional work when they have extra capacity.

Principle 2: Every engineer should be able to point to an item in the current sprint that they are working on.  Once work is started on something new, it should be pulled into the sprint if it isn't already part of the sprint.

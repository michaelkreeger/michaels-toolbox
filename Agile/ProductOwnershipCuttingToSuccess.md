Hey Team,

I wanted to share something that has been a recurring topic among the teams.  Many teams and specifically PO’s over the last month have faced backlogs which contain more work than can expect to be accomplished in the fixed time window of the release (be it 5/27, 8/1, or 2/1/2021).  When faced with this situation, the single most effective way to fix this is to cut features / functionality.  It is the simplest, most painful at first, and yet healthiest thing for the business.  In fact, I strongly encourage everyone to cut (or deprioritize) as much as possible from backlogs to the point of pain even when not faced with capacity constraints.  

To illustrate why, consider the following hypothetical scenario…

Product Owner A:
Let’s assume that product owner A is an overly aggressive product owner who cuts, and cuts, and cuts to the point where they’ve cut too much.  They said no to just about everything.  What happens?  Well, the team finished their work early before the official release date and now based on the customers feedback or team insights the team decides to add some features they had previously cut.  This delayed decision and flexibility on what additional features to add allowed for prioritization to be done with the best possible information later in the process.  Since the team felt confident in their release early on they boy scouted their code, remediated technical debt as it occurred, and were able to maintain a stable pace of delivery of features.  Post release the customer asked for features and the team was able to deliver them at the same consistent pace as they had previously.  
 
Product Owner B:
Product owner B cut some features but in the end just barely made the release because they tried to keep as much on the teams plate as possible (commonly incorrect applications of Parkinson’s Law to software development) or didn’t want to tell the customer no to some features.  The team wasn’t able to add any additional features based on customer feedback because well…time’s up.  The team also felt pressured to deliver more so they cut a few corners early to deliver faster and since technical debt is real this ultimately came back to zap them later.  Their initial pace was higher but over time it slowed.  Post release the customer asked for features and the team was able to deliver them at a significantly slower pace due to the technical debt of the system and maintenance issues.

I’ve seen this play out in real life.  I will also tell you that Team A actually delivers more features, with better prioritization, and higher value in the end and can continue to deliver features at a faster pace than Team B.


Alternatives to cutting that are less or simply not effective
-	Hire more people:  This is subject to what is known as the “J Curve” where early velocity for the team that we tried to help slows because they are trying to mentor or onboard new individuals.  As the saying goes, “adding more people to an already late project just makes it later”.  While not precise, we generally figure 3-6 months before investments in onboarding / cross training begin to have any net positive ROI for a release.
-	Cut quality:  Again, software development is cumulative so cutting corners, letting technical debt accumulate, etc. inevitably slows the team down.  As the saying goes, “the only way to go fast is to go well”.
-	Delay the release date.  The business likely has committed to the date and may have made significant investments (both political and financial) in hitting a specific date.


All food for thought, happy to discuss further or help anyway I can.  Criticism or different ideas always welcome.  Keep cutting…

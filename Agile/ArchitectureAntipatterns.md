Architects to design and coders to take tickets and follow the pattern.

The model isn't efficient or as effective because..
1. Software development is inherrently knowledge work and can't be planned or patterned to the point where it isn't.  Even rudimentary complexity will push the psychological levers in the brain to be governed by the the laws of higher brain function. 
2. It introduces a dependency / hand-off which require communication.  
3. Weakens the feedback loop as the architect who may have the bad design may have caused consequences for the dev who implemented it.  
4. Combining the doer with the thinker is critical optimizing innovation for the business.
5. Hierarchy / power gradient incrases which causes drop in innovative ideas (based on research in Leadership is Language)
6. Often the most important thing with architecture and design is not that we get it right, but that we can change it as we need to.  For that we need the XP / technical excellence discplines and those are tightly wound into how developers work.  Trying to separate the developer from the designer is an artificial divide.  They are separate skills but best done by the same person as they are so tightly coupled.

These can be partially mitigated by having an architect for every team and having them part of the scrum team.  This then has some other consequences.
1. Single point of failure / scale within the team.  Architect goes on vacation, the team can't do any design work.
2. Hierarchy within the team which causes a drop in innovation.

The model of having an architect imbedded within the teams was the model we had at Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin and we were by far the highest performing teams I ever worked with.  That said, I don't recommend that model for us for all the previous reason and also because we had a far healthier cutlure with far less power gradients between leadership and teams.



This could be mitigated by having an architect for every team and embedded but then you still have a brittle team as a single point of failure / scale.

Context
When working on a project with critical dates it can be challenging to balance the needs for high quality and also delivering the expected outcomes to the clients.  This is meant to help guide teams as they are trying to determine how to both achieve the desired outcomes and also keep quality high.

 

Goal
The goal is to achieve a desired outcome as quick as possible.  To do this we must strive for High Quality and Simple Designs.  In software engineering, the only way to go fast is to go well.  Attempts at going fast with bad engineering practices actually kills productivity and slows down the team.  Likewise, over engineering systems or building business functionality that is seldom used also slows down the team.  The goal is to do only the necessary work to achieve the desired outcome and to do that work with high quality.

Quality
Ensuring the software works as expected and can be evolved in the future as we get market feedback.  We care about all aspects of quality including the seen and unseen features of the product.  This covers everything from documentation to code to reliability of the software to preform as expected.  Quality is often measured by the absence of “surprises” experience by customers & product owners.  A product owner should never be surprised with how a product functions or fails to operate.

Simplicity
Simplicity is defined as “the art of maximizing the work not done.”  The safest thing to always cut in a product is business functionality that provides little value or is not on a critical path currently for the outcomes needed.  Additionally, other technical features can be cut if doing so is safe and doesn’t sacrifice the quality of the product.  Cutting unit test is not a good idea.  Deciding to go for a simpler architecture design now with the plan to evolve it in the future may very well be.  Knowing that we need to make the product configurable by client but not creating a UI to make the configuration changes may be acceptable for now and then a configuration UI can be added in the future.

 

Cultural Context
One of the most misunderstood and miscommunicated words in our industry today is the word quality. We have been trained as consumers that we can get the same item for less by purchasing the store brand, the less fancy product, the item made of cheaper materials...the product of lesser quality. In software engineering though and especially in literature this perspective, approach, or word would actually be SIMPLICITY.  When we talk about quality in software engineering we are often talking about the disciplines necessary to ensure the product actually works and the ease at which it can be changed.  Thus the communication gap. Those on one side strive for the cheaper item and see the time spent on quality as a lever that can be pulled. Those on the other side see quality as indispensable and insist that we focus on making it simpler. The reality is we are often saying similar things and have the same goal but just using different words and having a different context. This divide is further exacerbated by those in the technology community that also have this consumerist perspective on quality. This leads to miscommunication and understanding of those even within the software development space. How many teams when asked to do work of high-quality hold to keeping things simple? Do they gold plate their software trying to make it high quality? How many teams, when asked to produce an MVP, think that the lever they should pull is to cut automated tests, pair programming, or other well-established disciplines of high quality. No wonder when some are introduced to software engineering and read things about high quality they think that it somehow implies the need to spend more money or time. If you want to get to market faster and save money... high-quality simple software is the way to go. It beats the low-quality complex software every time.

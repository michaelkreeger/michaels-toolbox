Intent
The purpose of a Transition O3 is for the previous manager ([previous manager name]) to share final feedback about the employee ([employee name]) to the new manager (Mike).  This has the benefit of ensuring a smooth and transparent handoff of any past conversations, feedback, career growth plans, etc. with the benefit of everyone being in the conversation.

Feedback I’m looking for from candidate interviews.
1)	Would you hire this candidate? Yes / No
2)	On a scale of 1-5 would you hire this individual?
1	= Hell no, would not work with this person, if you hire this person I quit
2	 
3	= Yes, but was a close call
4	 
5	= Absolutely yes, pay them double, can’t wait for them to join
3)	List some Pros / Cons of the candidate as you see it.
